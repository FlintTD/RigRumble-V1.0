"Day to Day Operations

Now that your team has deployed to their stations it is time to get to work!  Managing a Mobile Derrick means that you have no tonly taken responsability for the lives of your subordinates, you have also taken responsability for a considerable company investment.  From this day forward, you will be held liable for not only your resource quotas, but also maintaining the Mobile Derrick, ensuring all systems and subsystems remain operational, and protecting the lives of your coworkers, subordinates, and any manager or AVERDI™ employee that may arive on Mobile Derrick 231.

Don't feel overwhelmed; you don't have to do all of the required maintenance and mining yourself!  Remember Delegation: one of the AVERDI Core Principals™.  It is the job of your subordiantes to actually operate and repair the Mobile Derreck.  Your job is to manage them, and to manage the local company resources onboard Mobile Derreck 231 to ensure that operations do not cease.  Your cabin will have a multi-screen terminal with exclusive administrative access to Local Server 231, the computer system onboard Mobile Derreck 231.  Using this, you can catalog and manage the derreck's onboard resources.  These resources include both static assets, like devices and structures, and dynamic assets, like water and ore.  Proper expenditure and wise collection of these company assets will ensure your success and continued employment.

From time to time you may need to answer questions that you don't know the answer to, intervene to settle peronal disputes, officiate marriages, declare martial law, and (most importantly) schedule office parties to maintain a jubilant work environment.  As Foreman, you have been authorized as an acting Human Resources™ Officer, and have the full authority of a Human Resources™ Officer until such time as an Officer can be deployed to your Mobile Derrick.  Do not feel overwhelmed!  Not only does this guide walk you through comprehensive template scenarios for these circumstances, your bookshelf also provides you with a pre-approved AVERDI Group™ endorsed textbook full of scientific© answers to common on-the-job querys."
